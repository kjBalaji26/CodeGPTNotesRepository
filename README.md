# practiceGit

Here we are planning to practice git hub commands...... :)

git clone is used to clone the repository

SELECT keyword is used to fetch data from document.
git checkout -b branchname - This comment is used to create new branch from existing branch.

git checkout branchname - this comment is used to switch branch 

UNION keyword combine the results of two result sets and removes duplicates.

UNION ALL doesn't remove duplicate rows.


we are practicing git and using this repo as a Notes storage...

Going to learn another new concepts. I am typing something.
